Issues of non-availability of raw materials and indigenous manufacturing makes it even more challenging for India to aim for mass electrification of vehicles. Metal-air particularly Aluminium-air technology is a viable alternative which can make mobility clean and green without the need for charging infrastructure with a range of more than 1000 km. Log 9 Materials, a local Bangalore startup has made Aluminium and Water the new fuel. The innovation can not only revolutionize electric mobility both in consumer and logistics segment but also makes eco-friendly power backup viable",

We also have close tie-ups with reputed educational institues like- Ramkrishna Mission Narendrapur and Ramkrishna Mission Deoghar\nNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY | JAMSHEDPUR, JHARKHAND, 831014\nwhere specialized guidance is provided for JEE(Main & Advanced), NEET-UG and KVPY.

By choosing not to design, manufacture or market any semiconductor products under its own name, the Company ensures that it never competes directly with its customers. Today, TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, manufacturing 10,436 different products using 261 distinct technologies for 481 different customers in 2018.\n\nWith a large and diverse global customer base, TSMC manufactured semiconductors cover a wide range of applications in the computer, communications, consumer, industrial and standard segments and are used in a variety of end markets including mobile devices, high performance computing, automotive electronics and the Internet of Things (IoT). Strong diversification helps to smooth fluctuations in demand, which, in turn, helps the Company maintain higher levels of capacity utilization and profitability.\n\nAnnual capacity of the manufacturing facilities managed by TSMC and its subsidiaries exceeded 12 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2018. These facilities include three 12-inch wafer GIGAFAB® fabs, four 8-inch wafer fabs, and one 6-inch wafer fab  all in Taiwan  as well as one 12-inch wafer fab at a wholly owned subsidiary, TSMC Nanjing Company Limited, and two 8-inch wafer fabs at wholly owned subsidiaries, WaferTech in the United States and TSMC China Company Limited.\n\nTSMC provides customer service, account management and engineering services through offices in North America, Europe, Japan, China, and South Korea. At the end of 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries employed more than 48,000 people.\n\nThe Company is listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) under ticker number 2330, and its American Depositary Shares (ADSs) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol TSM.",

We imagined a better kind of smartphone and a better way of doing things. Our goal was to build a smartphone we would want to use ourselves. What started as a passion project soon turned into a global community. Fueled by a groundswell of support, we sought to redefine the way Android smartphones were built. \nThis is who we are. We are a community looking to deliver true flagship experiences with smooth performance, quality software, and expert craftsmanship. We focus on the things that matter most to us - design and user experience. Most importantly, were not just doing it for ourselves. Our mission is to share the best technology, built hand-in-hand with you.",

That way, you can invest something new that is truly important. When re-thinking about old Japanese culture that emphasize on passing goods from parents to children, then grandchildren, how about we now think of not only from insider of family, but passing the valued good to someone who really cherish it. This is basic idea of our business. We want more and more people to understand the value of reuse, and want people to make recycle a part of their lives. That way, someday the reuse would become a common concept. We are heading to a new challenge.\n\n■Type of Business\nSale and purchase of branded goods, precious metals, antique items. \nDevelop related software products.\n\n■Stock Exchange Listings\nTSE Mothers\n(Tokyo Stock Exchange:Market Of The High-growth and Emerging Stocks)\n\n■Revenues\nConsolidated：31.5 billion yen (Fiscal year ended in August 2018)",
